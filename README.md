# minesweeper-at-home
Making minesweeper at home and at school during free time, new version of an older WIP version where I got tangled up in a bunch of different branches :&lt;
Releases will be released every so often, mainly for my own use to test it as pre-releases. As of 18/9/25 I am having issues creating a local enviromnent/machine on GitHub on my school computer, albiet this may be alleviated when I work on it at home. Thanks!

Anyone should be able to use this, fork this, improve it etc. Should be covered in the MIT License. Happy minesweeping!
